# Hey, I'm Avani Pathak 👋

- Cloud builder · Automation enthusiast · Endlessly curious  
- Exploring the intersection of cloud infrastructure, ML workflows, and real-world automation.  
- I like making things work — and making them work better.

## What I'm Exploring right now!

- Kubernetes and observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)  
- Advanced Terraform patterns and multi-cloud workflows (Azure and GCP)  
- CI/CD, scalable monitoring, and production-ready infrastructure

## My Master's Project: Serverless ML Workflows At The Edge

I spent the past year building a modular, serverless machine learning workflow system for edge devices like Jetson Orin and Coral TPU.

This system:
- Runs six end-to-end ML workflows (ETL, object detection, federated learning, ECG anomaly detection, MapReduce, and TTS)
- Uses FastAPI-based microservices and Docker containers
- Enables integrating GPU/TPU acceleration while preserving serverless abstractions

The goal is to let researchers deploy ML workflows efficiently, even in constrained environments.

## Automating Workflows At CCRC, UGA

As part of my work at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC), I'm building automation tools for research and project lifecycle tracking.

- Microsoft Power Automate for dynamic quote creation  
- Forms and integrated pipelines for structured requests  
- Microsoft Project for end-to-end project monitoring  

The goal? Replace chaos with clarity, making life easier for researchers and admins alike.

## Projects I've built

- `fast_neural_style_transfer` – stylizes videos and images in real-time using Jetson Nano.
- `DifferentiallyPrivateDeepLearning` – trained deep learning models with built-in privacy guarantees.
- `rust_wikipedia_wrapper` – created a Rust CLI wrapper for easier MediaWiki API usage.
- `uga_moviebooking_sys` – built a full-stack theater booking system with clean backend logic.
- `facial_emotion_recognition` – used PyTorch to predict emotions from facial expressions.
- `career_predictor` – made a Flask app that suggests career paths based on your preferences.
