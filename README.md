## What I'm exploring right now!

- Kubernetes and observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- AWS cloud certification
- Advanced Terraform patterns and multi-cloud workflows (Azure and GCP)  
- CI/CD, scalable monitoring, and production-ready infrastructure
- AI agents integration

## My master's project: Serverless machine learning workflows at edge

I spent the past year building a modular, serverless machine learning workflow system for edge devices like Jetson Orin and Coral TPU.

This system:
- Runs six end-to-end ML workflows (ETL, Object detection, Federated learning, ECG anomaly detection, MapReduce, and Text-to-speech)
- Uses FastAPI-based microservices and Docker containers
- Enables integrating GPU/TPU acceleration while preserving serverless abstractions

The goal was to let researchers deploy ML workflows efficiently, even in constrained environments.

## Automating workflows At CCRC, UGA

As part of my work at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC), I'm building automation tools for research and project lifecycle tracking.

- Microsoft Power Automate for dynamic quote creation
- Forms and integrated pipelines for structured requests  
- Microsoft Project for end-to-end project monitoring  
The goal here was to replace chaos with clarity, making life easier for researchers and admins at CCRC.
